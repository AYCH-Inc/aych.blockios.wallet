#  - the parameter clean(true) is required for all lanes to prevent the following error in the new Xcode build system:
#    Cycle in dependencies between targets 'Blockchain' and 'RxCocoa'; building could produce unreliable results.

#  From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42962571/what-is-the-difference-between-skip-build-and-test-without-building-on-fastlane
#  The skip_build parameter will omit the build command from the generated xcodebuild command that ultimately gets executed by scan.
#  This means that if there is a built product in DerivedData, it will use it instead of recompiling your app.
#  If there is no build product in DerivedData, it will rebuild the product.
